## :question: Business Problem Statement
Christmas was just over, and Walmartâ€™s Sr. sales executive, Mrs. Karen Murdock, was very disappointed with the way her staff handled the business during potentially the most profitable period of the year. She wants her employees to start early and prepare for situations like these. The task is to study and perform data-driven decision-making on the data set provided by the organization. This involves analyzing customer behavior, such as how customers buy when they visit, and what they prefer. Do customers spend more on certain days or hours? Do they often buy some products together? The goal is to devise practical suggestions to help Walmart get the best out of its staff and craft effective sales tactics.

## :warning: Main Challenges
- The variance between data values was significantly low, hence making immediate takeaways a challenge.
- The data provided was only for the initial three months, i.e., Jan, Feb, and March. In order to provide implementable suggestions, at least 6 months of data would have been a bare minimum.
