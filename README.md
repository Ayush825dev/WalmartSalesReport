Business Problem Statement
•	Christmas was just over and Walamart’s Sr. sales executive Mrs. Karen Murdock was very disappointed with how her staff handled the business during potentially the most profitable period of the year. She wants her employees to have an early start and prepare for situations like these. Study and perform data-driven decision-making on the data set provided by the organization. Comprehend customer behavior, this involves analyzing how customers buy. when they visit? and what they prefer. Do customers spend more on certain days or hours? Do they often buy some products together? Devise practical suggestions to get Walmart the best out of their staff and craft effective sales tactics.
Main Challenges
•	The variance between data values was significantly low hence making immediate takeaways became a challenge.
•	Data provided was only for the initial three months i.e., Jan, Feb, and March. To provide implementable suggestions, at least 6 months of data would have been a bare minimum.
Objectives of the Project
•	Identify the time intervals of the day during which the client can enforce her best employees to get optimum results.
•	Understand customer behavior and preferences, such as buying patterns, visiting times, and product combinations.
•	Develop data-driven strategies to improve the staff’s efficiency, customer satisfaction, and sales revenue for the next peak season.
